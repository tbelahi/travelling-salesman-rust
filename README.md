# travelling-salesman-rust

Rust traduction/implementation of the travelling salesman problem I already implemented in [Clojure](https://github.com/tbelahi/travelling-salesman) and in [Julia](https://github.com/tbelahi/travelling-salesman-julia). I do that in order to learn and understand Rust. 

## objectives

  - Learn Rust
  - improve the interface for the input
  - performance improvement check
